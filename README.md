This is a chatbot for takealot, which helps the user to track their items and also answer a few questions like delivery time. The project was build using Deep Learning Method. Also, the tools used are Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook, Tensorflow, Keras. Thank data flair training to provide with this tutorial, you can use this link to check the codes and more details about the project here(https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-chatbot-project/) I did change the data to the project and used the data so this can easily be implemented for online shopping. Also, I did include some of the packages in the codes so everything can work without an error.
